# ðŸ“Š Quantifying Bias in Vaccine Efficacy Estimates Due to Temporally Correlated Exposure

**Ando, H., Oâ€™Malley, A. J., & Nishi, A.**

This repository contains the simulation framework and visualization tools used to assess the impact of temporally correlated exposure on vaccine efficacy estimates. The study is based on a stochastic infectious window model, designed to capture dynamic contact and exposure patterns in infectious disease clinical trials. Resources provided here allow for full replication of the main results, including the generation of all figures.
